# Machine-learning-based-classification-of-DDoSattacks

# Project Description

Distributed network attacks, commonly known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, exploit specific limitations of network assets such as the framework of an authorized organization's site. Traditional methods have often relied on outdated datasets, such as the KDD dataset, to identify and analyze these attacks. However, to address the current state of DDoS attacks, it is crucial to work with the latest datasets.

This project utilizes the UNWS-np-15 dataset, extracted from a GitHub repository, and employs Python as a simulator. The main objective is to classify and predict types of DDoS attacks using advanced machine learning approaches, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.
